# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday 2 November 2020
##### Learning Vue.js

**Today's Progress**: Set up a Vue project, learn about components, data events and directives.

**Thoughts:** 
- Vue was initially not installing as I didn't have permission to do so on my system. However, a quick google and look at a Stack Overflow thread suggested using `sudo npm i @vue/cli -g` rather than just `npm i @vue/cli -g` as I was originally doing.

- It was interesting to learn that you can set up a Vue project using Vue UI (in terminal: `vue ui`), as well as just the command line (`vue create *project name*`).
