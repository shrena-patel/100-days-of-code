# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday 2 November 2020
#### Learning Vue.js

**Today's Progress**: Set up a Vue project, learn about Vue components, events and vue router.

**Thoughts:** 

- Vue was initially not installing as I didn't have permission to do so on my system. However, a quick google and look at a Stack Overflow thread suggested using `sudo npm i @vue/cli -g` rather than just `npm i @vue/cli -g` as I was originally doing.
- It was interesting to learn that you can set up a Vue project using Vue UI (in terminal: `vue ui`), as well as just the command line (`vue create *project name*`). This brings up a Vue user interface in the browser - from there you can add vue router, start the server, and view dependencies.
- I have build projects in React before, so it was useful to see the similarities between React and Vue.
- Vue also seems similar to Handlebars in the use of views and layouts.
